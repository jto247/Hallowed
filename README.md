# Hallowed Footwear React Native Mobile Application

This is a mobile application built using React Native for Hallowed Footwear, a fictional footwear e-commerce brand. The app was meant to be capable of scanning customer's foot sizes but hasn't been implemented yet.

## Status

The front end of the application is mostly completed, with all the essential features implemented. Application is able to display 3D models of shoes. The shoe model and mat file are currently stored within assets/images.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following:

- Android/iOS emulator or a physical device capable of USB debugging
- Node.js and npm installed on your system

## How to Run the App

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jto247/hallowed-footwear-react-native.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```shell
cd hallowed-footwear-react-native
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

4. Start the Metro bundler:

```shell
npm start
```

5. Run the application on your desired platform:

- For Android:
  - Open an Android emulator or connect a physical device with USB debugging enabled.
  - In a separate terminal window, run the following command:

    ```shell
    a - run on android
    ```

- For iOS:
  - Open an iOS simulator or connect a physical device.
  - In a separate terminal window, run the following command:

    ```shell
    i - run on iOS
    ```

Now, the Hallowed Footwear application should be up and running on your emulator or device.

## Further Implementations

Due to the time constraints of this capstone, there are many further implementations and development that could be done for future projects:

- Once the AR section is completed, it needs to be incorporated into this appliaction.
- Implementing a user database into this application (Hallowed Footwear has a HubSpot CRM, try to work with their API)
- Implement a shoe database into this application, where all measurements are kept (currently they are being stored in excel files at hallowed footwear, maybe try implement a sql database)
- Once the AR section is working, implement a way to recommend certain shoes depending on measurements.
- Further flesh out the UI designs as it has been kept fairly simple
- Implement a way to connect the app to HallowedFootwear's products and also display them.
- Flesh out the user profile screen (wanted to implement user profile pictures).
